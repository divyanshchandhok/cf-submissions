## Description

It is known that a contest can be represented by a string $s$, consisting of uppercase Latin letters that denote problems. It is also known that a contest is difficult if it contains "`FFT`" or "`NTT`" as a contiguous substring.

Your task is to rearrange the problem in contest $s$ in such a way that this contest is not difficult. If the initial contest is not difficult, you may leave it as it is.

## Input Specification

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^{4}$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$).

Additional constraints on the input data:

- the total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$.

## Output Specification

For each test case, output a string — a non-difficult contest that was obtained from $s$ by rearranging the letters.

If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any. It can be shown that at least one correct answer always exists.
